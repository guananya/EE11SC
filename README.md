# EE11SC- Dream It Build It!

Here are two projects my friend (Zoe Quake!) and I built at the end of our 3-week soco program. After learning how to build with adafruit and circuitpython, we implemented what we learnt to make 2 items for our dorm room- a keypad doorlock and an arcade-style mini basketball hoop.
